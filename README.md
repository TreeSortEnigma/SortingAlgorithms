Team members and roles
Team Members: 
Abigail Swinson -  Tree Sort, Bubble Sort, CountingSort & GUI
Andrew Leu - Bucket Sort, Cube Sort, Shell Sort & Tree Sort & (GUI)    
Indigo Columna -  Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, TimSort & Tree Sort
Hedy Wang -  Quicksort, MergeSort & Tree Sort 
Hailun Xu - Radix sort, Tree sort, Heap Sort & GUI - 

I propose that everyone should research and code 2 sorting algorithms of their choice, and whoever’s working on the GUI can just code 1 algorithm. However everyone will also code a Tree sort on their own because it’s pretty unique and it will expose you to using binary trees and even out the workload a bit.

Purpose and Justification
This project will demonstrate knowledge of sorting algorithms, recursion and the usage of binary trees. It will prepare us more directly for coding interviews and can also be something concise, tangible and visually stimulating to put on a resume. 
This project will also be a useful tool in teaching computer science students fundamental sorting algorithms.  The graphical aspect of this tool is helpful to visualize the process. 

Materials Required
A computer and an internet connection is all we need. There’s even browser-based Java compilers. Also we should consider starting a simple github repository as that will be a good experience to have since almost all coders use it.

Investigation, development, or experimentation to be conducted
There’s a wealth of information about sorting algorithms on the internet. It’s all been done already. The hardest part will be putting the GUI together but even that is fairly minimal.

Tasks, time estimates, owners, and dependencies
We should be able to put this together in about a week or less.
